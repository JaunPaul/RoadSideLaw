# **Roadside Checks**

BACKGROUND TO THIS UPDATE

Statutory Instrument 129/2015: Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use) regulations replaced SI 154/2010, and came into operation on 14 December 2015\.

ZRP Traffic – Highway Patrol were issued with an updated Schedule of Deposit Fines in February, 1999

For the guidance of motorists, this update reflects the most frequently encountered requirements of the various acts, including SI 129/2015 (Construction, Equipment and Use) Regulations, and the relevant Deposit Fines.

DEPOSIT FINES

The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) apply a Schedule of Deposit Fines for a range of vehicle equipment, use, licensing, etc., offences discovered during roadside checks. The most common examples are listed here. The maximum deposit fine a police officer can legally impose is $20 per offence. (A level 3 fine). A fine higher than level 3 can only be imposed by a magistrate after a court appearance.

Deposit fines are imposed per offence, and if found with more than one ‘issue’, the police officer can ‘add them up’. The deposit fines listed in this document will assist with calculations.

ZRP may not “double up” the fines listed. For example Sect. 39(2) No white front reflectors \- $20. The maximum fine that can be imposed is $20, NOT $20 per non-compliant reflector, i.e. $40.

The ZRP member will complete an Admission of Guilt form (Z.R.P. N.TFC), with particular attention to the Charge (Section and Statutory enactment) field, which details the regulations being contravened.

A copy of the legible and completed Z.R.P. N.TFC form is essential for any motorist who wishes to query the deposit fine. Form 265, providing the facility of paying a fine within 7 days, is NOT currently allowed as an option.

Quote

The deposits as listed in this item\* are to be regarded as maximum fine for offence

committed. Where the offence has occurred for example on a bright moonlight, or in a clearly lit area, the deposit may be halved.

Pass-lamps or fog-lamps – Sect. 19

1\. A motor vehicle may, in addition to headlamps, be equipped with not more than two “pass- lamps” or “fog-lamps”

2\. To be fitted at height not exceeding 600 mm above the ground, and so focused and directed as to avoid dazzling the vision of the driver of any approaching vehicle on a level road.

Note: The Schedule of Deposit Fines states: c.s 19(2) Use fog or pass lamps together with headlight, per lamp \- $20. Motorists are being fined $20 per lamp, total $40, for a) use of fog lamps and headlamps simultaneously, b) in daylight and c) at night

1\. There is no reference under Sect. 19 to it being an offence to use Fog lamps and Headlamps simultaneously, either during daylight hours (6:30am to 5:30pm) or at night.

2\. ZRP might be relying on RGN 412/1972 which stated “The driver of a motor vehicle on a road shall not use pass-lamps or fog-lamps at night when the headlamps of such vehicle are being used.” However, RGN 412/1972 was repealed by SI 154/2010 and subsequently by the current SI 129/2015.

3\. Therefore the fine listed in the Schedule of Deposit Fines has no legal basis and should be removed. Finally, although academic, a fine of $20 per lamp, a total of $40, exceeds the Level 3 fine limit of $20; and cannot be imposed as a roadside fine but only by a magistrate after a court appearance.

Stop lights (brake lights) – Sect. 24

All motor vehicles and trailers are to be equipped with at least two red stop lights. To be kept clean, undamaged, properly secured and in working condition.

Rear registration plate light – Sect. 26

All motor vehicles, motorcycles  or trailers are to be equipped with at least one white lamp capable of illuminating the rear registration plate. To be kept clean, undamaged, properly secured and in

working condition.

Spotlights – Sect. 28

1\. A motor vehicle may be equipped with not more than two spotlights, fitted at the front of the  vehicle at a height below the headlamps (headlamps are referred to in Sect. 18).

2\. A spotlight fitted to a vehicle and used solely for the purpose of “hunting, searching and night repair work” may be fitted above the height of the headlamps.

Note: There is no reference under Sect. 28 to it being an offence to use Spot lights during daylight hours (6:30am to 5:30pm).

## EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT

Warning triangle (referred to as visual warning device) – Sect. 52

1\. Two red triangles are mandatory.

2\. To be reflective both sides.

3\. Length of sides: 42,5 cm

4\. To be marked with the manufacturer’s name, a serial number and year of manufacture.

5\. A pair is required for a trailer as well as for the towing vehicle.

 Note: Triangles are not required to be SAZ approved. As long as the triangle is stored in an easily accessible “light-tight” compartment, it is not essential the triangle is carried in an opaque container.

Spare wheel, tools and fire extinguisher: all vehicles – Sect. 53

It is mandatory for a motor vehicle to carry:

1\. A “serviceable” spare wheel

2\. An “efficient” jack

3\. A wheel-brace or wheel-spanner capable of undoing the vehicle’s wheel nuts

Note: There is no reference to it being an offence to carry a ‘space saver’ spare wheel. The type of jack is not specified, e.g. scissor, bottle jack, etc.

The opinion of Big Sky and our advisors:

1\. Sect. 53 (1) (a) states the spare wheel must be serviceable, in the same way a fire extinguisher must be serviceable. If your spare wheel is inflated, has sufficient tread and is suitable for use, ZRP should accept it.

2\. However ZRP is applying Sect. 14 (6) (a) No person shall drive on any road a vehicle if \- (a) any tires on any one axle of the vehicle are of a different size or type or construction. Which would be the case if the space-saver tire was being USED in the event of an emergency.

3\. In practice, while the space-saver is stored in its compartment, the motorist is complying with both Sect. 14 and Sect. 53\.

4\. The greater risk to life for motorists is driving with full size, unsecured wheels in small passenger compartments, in an attempt to comply.

Fire extinguisher

1\. Mandatory. 0,75kg (light vehicles) and 1,5kg minimum (heavy vehicles). 0,75kg are not generally available so 1kg units are commonly purchased.

2\. To be SAZ approved “or any other International Standards Authority”, and displaying the mark of the applicable Standards Authority.

3\. To be serviceable.

Note: The color of the fire extinguisher is not specified. Our understanding of “serviceable” is the extinguishers must be refillable. There is no legislation we are aware of requiring the above units to be serviced, however regular servicing is recommended. To be professionally refilled when in the red,

i.e. above or below pressure.

The provisions of Sect. 53 – Spare wheels, tools and fire extinguishers – do not apply to

foreign registered vehicles that are in transit or on a temporary entry permit.

Fluorescent safety jacket – Sect. 74 (4) (b)

Mandatory for pedal cyclists and motor cyclists at night, and must be SAZ approved.

Note: Carrying a fluorescent safety jacket is NOT mandatory for motorists but recommended for

personal safety. (It is mandatory in Mozambique).

VEHICLE LIVERY

Retro reflector: general requirements – Sect. 32

1\. “Retro reflector” (or reflective tape), shall be of the honeycomb grade (high intensity grade) or diamond grade.

2\. To be circular, rectangular or circular in shape.

3\. If circular, at least 60 mm in diameter. A triangular or rectangular shape must have a minimum area of 3 000 mm2.

Note: Although SI 129/2015 refers to Honeycomb grade OR Diamond grade tape, ZRP are only accepting the Honeycomb type. Expect to be fined for anything other than Honeycomb grade. As the width of reflective tape is typically 50mm, a piece of tape 50 X 60mm gives an area of 3 000 mm

Trailers (including horse-trailers) – Sect. 41

1\. All trailers must have a White T (extreme right, front) and Red T(extreme right, rear).

2\. A light trailer (load capacity which does not exceed 550 kg) to display a continuous Red retro reflector at the rear of the vehicle, horizontally to within 400 mm of each side of the trailer.

3\. ‘Heavy’ trailers (load capacity exceeding 550 kg) must be fitted with a rear warning sign (a red/yellow chevron plate). Sect. 38\.

4\. GVM/NVM information to be displayed on the left side. Sect. 72

5\. A light trailer is not required to display GVM/NVM information or to be braked.

Note: A light trailer has a load capacity which does not exceed 550 kg. However, the “Schedule of Deposit Fines” states that trailers with a factory rated load capacity of 545 kg or more are classified as “HEAVY”. A load capacity not exceeding 550 kg is the correct description of a light trailer.

The Nett Vehicle Mass stated on the left hand side of a trailer MUST MATCH the Nett Mass (kg) appearing on the trailers’ licence disc. The Deposit Fine is $10.

Sect. 40 \- Reflectors on the sides of vehicles are required when a vehicle or a vehicle towing a trailer has an overall length exceeding 8 metres: continuous Amber retro reflectors, horizontally to within 400mm of the outer edges of the vehicle (front and back). Required on all heavy vehicles.

Deposit fine:

c.s 40(1) No continuous Amber reflector on sides of vehicle (towing, length exceeding 8m)Not stated

Sect. 39 \- Light motor vehicles must have two White honeycomb retro-reflectors at the front, and

two Red honeycomb retro-reflectors at the rear, within 400mm of the sides.

Note:

1\. “Commercial vehicles” include vanettes, pick-ups and double-cabs, not exceeding 2 300kg NVM. SUV’s (station-wagons) are not classified as commercial vehicles.

2\. The requirements under “commercial vehicles” apply whether or not the vehicle is in private use.

3\. The Nett Vehicle Mass stated on the left hand side of a commercial vehicle MUST MATCH the Nett Mass (kg) appearing on the vehicles’ licence disc. The Deposit Fine is $10.

WINDSCREENS – Sect. 54 (3) (a)

All glass must allow “no interference with the driver’s vision” and where the glass is tinted, it must ensure a safe degree of visibility.

\#\# USE OF ROADS AND VEHICLES

Towing – Sect. 69

1\. The space between the vehicles towing may not exceed 4 metres

2\. The nett mass of the vehicle being towed may not exceed the nett mass of the towing vehicle

3\. Unless the vehicle being towed is connected to the towing vehicle using a rigid tow bar, the maximum permissible speed is 30 km

4\. A motor vehicle may not tow more than 3 trailers

Note: The SI does not stipulate use of a rigid tow bar; only that “the towing vehicle ... is to be under proper control”. A rigid bar does provide the best control and is recommended.

Projecting loads – Sect. 78

Daylight hours (6:30am to 5:30pm) –a flag of bright red cloth, at least “ 600 millimeters

square” must be attached at the extreme rear of the load At night (5:30 pm to 06:30 am) – a bright red light must be attached at the extreme rear of the load. A solid square or circular or retro reflector (honeycomb), may be used instead of a bright red light.

Note: Based on our research, we understand the red cloth should be 600 mm x 600 mm. The current SDC regulations for the Conveyance of Loads, refers to 600 mm x 600 mm. As Zimbabwe is adopting

\#\# SAFETY BELTS

Road Traffic (Safety-belt) Regulations, 1987, SI 147/

## What form should the police issue you with when paying a fine?
The fine form issued by the police at Zimbabwe roadblocks is called the Form Z69 (j) Admission of Guilt. This form allows motorists to admit their guilt and pay the fine on the spot. If the fine is not paid immediately, the motorist may be issued a Form 265, which allows them to pay the fine at a police station within a specified period.
When paying a fine in Zimbabwe, the police officer is required to issue you a formal receipt or citation. This document typically includes the following details:
1. The nature of the offense
2. The amount of the fine
3. The date and time of the offense
4. The location where the offense occurred
5. The details of the issuing officer
